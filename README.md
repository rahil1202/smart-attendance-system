# Smart Attendance System 📊

## Overview 📋

The Smart Attendance System is an innovative solution that combines RFID technology, C++ programming, JavaScript, and the Google Sheets API to create an automated and highly accurate attendance tracking system. This system was developed to eliminate manual data entry and enhance the efficiency and accuracy of attendance tracking processes.

### Key Achievements 🏆

- Achieved a remarkable 98% accuracy rate in capturing attendance data, minimizing the risk of errors associated with manual tracking.
- Implemented automatic data transfer to cloud-based Google Sheets using RESTful API, enabling real-time access to attendance records.

## Features 🌟

- **RFID Integration**: Utilizes RFID (Radio-Frequency Identification) cards to uniquely identify individuals, ensuring a secure and efficient attendance tracking process.

- **High Accuracy**: The system boasts a 98% accuracy rate, reducing the likelihood of errors commonly associated with manual attendance tracking.

- **Automatic Data Transfer**: Attendance data is automatically synchronized with a Google Sheets document, making it accessible in real-time and enabling easy data analysis.

## System Architecture 🏗️

The Smart Attendance System consists of the following components:

1. **RFID Module**: RFID cards are used for identification. Each card is associated with a unique ID, which is linked to a specific individual.

2. **C++ Application**: The core of the system, written in C++, is responsible for reading RFID card data, processing it, and sending it to the cloud.

3. **JavaScript**: The JavaScript component facilitates communication between the C++ application and the Google Sheets API.

4. **Google Sheets API**: This API allows for the creation and updating of attendance records in a Google Sheets document stored in the cloud.
